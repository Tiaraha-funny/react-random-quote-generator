# Random Quote Generator in React

## Structure

I created an app file to handle the router and switch element so that you can link over the quotes. The users can click the random button in order to get the another quote. There is another file for the button from the link of the author's name so when the user press the button, they can get more quotes of the author that is in the button.

As long as I fulfill all the user needed, I gave my personal touches by adding transition, changing colors, or even creating my own layout,...
